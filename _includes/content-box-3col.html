More importantly, fact checking is done at this stage, and content is re-structured and re-organized, if required, while retaining the intended meaning. The editor looks for logic and flow of thought and makes the copy concise to enhance readability. They also check whether consistency has been maintained in style and format. The editor, based on the core theme of the copy, revises headlines and captions as needed.</div>
